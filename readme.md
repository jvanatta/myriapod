# Myriapod

A minimal Ghost theme, derived from the default Casper theme. I wanted a website with substantial control over the layout of images, even defying the separation of content and presentation.

This theme has the following design goals:

- Full posts displayed on the main page, with infinite scrolling. No clicking required.

- Minimal visual additives to posts. Post complexity comes from stacking module pieces defined in `myriapod.css`.

- A very simple lightbox. No navigation (this isn't for slideshows), no movies, no transitions. Just a simple click on/click off function to see an image, uncluttered.
